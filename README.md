## FAQs

**Q1: What websites can this crawler handle?**  
It works with most public websites that serve HTML pages. You can configure regex patterns to target specific domains or video types.

**Q2: Does it download videos or just provide links?**  
It only provides structured download URLs. You can use those URLs later to download videos using your preferred tools or scripts.

**Q3: How do I control costs or usage limits?**  
Use the `maxPages` parameter to set a hard limit on how many pages the crawler processes. Each page equals one billable event.

**Q4: Can I export results in multiple formats at once?**  
Yes, you can specify the desired output formats — JSON, CSV, HTML, or XML — and the tool will generate them simultaneously.
